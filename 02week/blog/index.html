        <h2>Daily Post</h2>
        <p>honestly am not sure what todays post is about, just anything is fine, writing down what ever comes to mind, and its so unfortunate that nothing
           comes to mind at the moment, so I guess todays post should be about nothings</p>
           <p>since we've all agreed our topic for today is nothing, here with are with a nothing post, feeling bad about this,
             but realy what am I supposed to when I've got nothing to write about, I guess am not a writer</p>
